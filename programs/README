All programs that you would like for MonsterOS to run. Place them in the programs directory.

Note: All MonsterOS programs have to be assembled by NASM. Please be aware that although  the program's extension is *.com. MS-DOS programs
are NOT be binary compatiable. That means that MS-DOS interrupts are not available on MonsterOS. Please see list of software interrupts, that
MonsterOS provides. 



Here is a template for those who would like to write a program that will be run by MonsterOS.


_start: ; Label name can techincally be anything because MonsterOS knows where to jump to the program


;Write Program Code Routine Here


ret ; Return is mandatory because control has to go back to operating system.

; Here anything like constant strings, words, bytes, can go here. Or anything acceptable by NASM





To assemble program type:

nasm -f bin source.asm -o output.com

Please NOTE that the output must be a maximum of 8 characters because MonsterOS's custom filesystem limits filenames to 8 characters.
