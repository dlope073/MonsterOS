This directory contains the VirtualBox files to run MonsterOS on VirtualBox. If you like inside the MonsterOS folder
there is the VHD Virtual Hard Disk Image which you can transfer to a USB stick and boot it from a USB stick and test it on 
an actual machine. But MonsterOS isn't fully stable so be careful.
